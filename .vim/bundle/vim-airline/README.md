# vim-airline

lean &amp; mean statusline for vim that's light as air

# rationale

there's already [powerline][b], why yet another statusline?

*  it's 100% vimscript; no python needed.
*  it's small.  i want the core plugin to be *less than 200 lines* as a rule (specifically adhering to the [open/closed principle][h]).
*  it gets you 90% of the way there; in addition to all the standard goodies, it integrates with [vim-bufferline][f], [fugitive][d], [unite][i], [ctrlp][j] and [syntastic][e].
*  it looks good with regular fonts, and provides configuration points so you can use unicode or powerline symbols.
*  it's fast to load, taking roughly 1ms.  by comparison, powerline needs 60ms on the same machine.
*  it's fully customizable; if you know a little `statusline` syntax you can tweak it to your needs.
*  it is trivial to write colorschemes; for a minimal theme you need to edit 9 lines of colors.

what about [old powerline][a]?

*  the old version still works well, but since it's deprecated new features won't get added

# why's it called airline?

i wrote the initial version on an airplane, and since it's light as air it turned out to be a good name.  thanks for flying vim!

# installation

this plugin follows the standard runtime path structure, and as such it can be installed with a variety of plugin managers:

*  [pathogen][k]
  *  `git clone https://github.com/bling/vim-airline ~/.vim/bundle/vim-airline`
*  [neobundle][l]
  *  `NeoBundle 'bling/vim-airline'`
*  [vundle][m]
  *  `Bundle 'bling/vim-airline'`
*  manual
  *  copy all of the files into your `~/.vim` directory

# configuration

`:help airline`

# faq/troubleshooting

*  the powerline font symbols are not showing up
  *  the older deprecated [vim-powerline][a] uses different codes compared to the newer [powerline][b].
  *  you can grab prepatched fonts at [powerline-fonts][c], or you can manually set the relevant `g:` variables
*  there is a pause when leaving insert mode
  *  you need to set `ttimeoutlen` to a low number; 50 is recommended
*  you get the error `Unknown function: fugitive#head`
  *  you are probably using version 1.2, which is very old...download v2 from the [project page][d].
*  airline doesn't appear until i create a new split
  *  add `set laststatus=2` to your vimrc
*  bufferline is printing to the statusline as well as the command bar
  *  you can disable automatic echoing by adding `let g:bufferline_echo = 0` to your vimrc
